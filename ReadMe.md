# How to Set Up and Run the Code

Follow these steps to download, set up, and run the provided Node.js application in your local environment. The application allows you to interact with a web-based service to fetch and display data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Visual Studio Code (or any code editor of your choice)

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Code as a Zip File**:
   - Click on the "Code" button located near the top right of the repository's main page.
   - In the dropdown menu, select "Download ZIP."
   - Save the downloaded zip file to a directory on your computer.

2. **Extract the Zip File**:
   - Locate the downloaded zip file on your computer.
   - Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory of your choice. This will create a folder containing the code and other files.

3. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**:
   - Launch Visual Studio Code (VSCode) if you have it installed.
   - Open the extracted project folder in VSCode. You can do this by selecting "File" > "Open Folder" and selecting the project folder.

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory in VSCode**:
   - In VSCode, navigate to the project directory by using the Explorer panel on the left.

5. **Initialize a New Project**:
   - Open the integrated terminal in VSCode by selecting "View" > "Terminal" from the top menu.
   - Run the following command to create a `package.json` file with default settings:

     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```

   This will generate a `package.json` file.

6. **Install Required Packages**:
   - In the VSCode integrated terminal, install the required Node.js packages (dependencies) listed in the `package.json` file. Use the following command:

     ```bash
     npm install express axios cheerio cors
     ```

   This command will download and install the necessary packages into your project folder.

7. **Run the Application**:
   - In the VSCode integrated terminal, run the following command to start the application:

     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```

   

8. **Access the Application**:
   - Once the application is running, it will start a server on a specified port (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
   - Open index.html to access the application.

9. **Interact with the Application**:
    - The application should have a user interface where you can enter the correct name and start chapter and end chapter.
    - After entering the required information, click a button to initiate the download.
    - Wait for the application to finish downloading and provide confirmation.
